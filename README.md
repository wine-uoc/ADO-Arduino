# ADO-Arduino

This repository contains the Arduino code for the **ADO-Arduino** project, designed to integrate Arduino-based systems with advanced sensor-based automation. The project is associated with the **WINE-UOC** initiative and supports various features such as real-time data collection, sensor fusion, and communication with external systems.

## 📂 Project Structure

The **src/** directory contains the core Arduino sketches and supporting libraries:

```
src/
│── main.ino           # Main Arduino script
│── main.h             # Configuration parameters and constant
└── README.md          # Documentation (this file)
```

## 🚀 Features

- **Sensor Integration**: Reads data from multiple sensors (temperature, humidity, etc.).
- **Communication**: Supports Serial, I2C, or wireless communication for data transmission.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### **Requirements**
- Arduino IDE (latest version)
- Compatible Arduino board (e.g., **Arduino Uno, Mega, or ESP32**)
- Required libraries (install via **Arduino Library Manager**)

### **Steps to Upload the Code**
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/wine-uoc/ADO-Arduino.git
   cd ADO-Arduino/src
   ```
2. Open **main.ino** in the **Arduino IDE**.
3. Select the correct **Board** and **Port**.
4. Click **Upload** to flash the code to your Arduino.

## 📜 File Descriptions

- **`main.ino`**: Entry point of the Arduino program, calling setup and loop functions.
- **`main.h`**: Stores global configurations, such as pin mappings and thresholds.
